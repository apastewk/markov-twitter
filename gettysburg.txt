Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're my

You can be a Sweet dreams are a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you.
